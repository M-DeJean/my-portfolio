            <p class="intro">Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
            <p>My name is Malik DeJean and I am a software Engineer from California. Los Angeles is my home, but I have been living in Sacramento for the past several years. I have recently started at a bootcamp for Thinkful and I am beyond excited to learn and become a successful developer.
            </p>

              Prior to learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS fundamentals at Thinkful, I also took computer science courses at UC Davis and am familiar with C. In addition, I also have a bit of expericne with Python and Rust. The more I learn about software development, the better this portfolio will get. Stay tuned!

              Since a young age I was always interested in building things. From Lego buildings, to Hot Wheels racetracks, the process of creating something has always fascinated me. It was only a matter of time before I had my own PC and fell in love with the endless creative possibilities that came with it. In middle school I found myself doing basic PHP code to create and manage my own web forum. I was coding before I knew what coding even was! After graduating high school, I was fortunate enough to participate in a Hackathon with Live Nation's tech department in Hollywood. This was my introduction to software engineering and I've dreamed of having a career as a developer ever since.

             My hobbies include basketball, Muay Thai (kickboxing), video games (preferrably Xbox), and anything Star Wars related. I belive that some of these activities can translate over to the Software Development field and will help me become a successful programmer. My experience with team sports such as baskteball and football have helped me learn to work with groups of people to accomplish a common goal. My experience in the ring is also a big contributor to my work ethic. I have competed in several Muay Thai events and training for a fight is extremely intense. It takes a different level of determination and it's an ultimate test of willpower and mental fortitude when competing in front of a crowd against another trained opponent. Fighting has not only strengthened me physically, but it has taught me discipline and dedication--two traits that anyone should have if they want to become successful at anyting.

            <p>
              My name is Malik DeJean and I am a Software Engineer from California. Los Angeles is my home, but I have been living in Sacramento for the past several years. I have recently started at a boot camp for Thinkful and I am beyond excited to learn and become a successful developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS fundamentals at Thinkful, I also took computer science courses
              at UC Davis and am familiar with C. I also have a bit of experience with Python and Rust. The more I learn
              about software development, the better this portfolio will get. Stay tuned!

              Since a young age, I was always interested in building things. From Lego buildings to Hot Wheels racetracks, the process of creating something has always fascinated me. It was only a matter of time before I had my very own PC and fell in love with the endless creative possibilities that came with it. In middle school I found myself doing basic PHP code to create and manage a web forum. I was coding before I knew what coding even was! After graduating high school, I was fortunate enough to participate in a Hackathon with Live Nation's tech department in Hollywood. This was my introduction to software engineering and I've dreamed of having a career as a developer ever since.

              My hobbies include basketball, Muay Thai (kickboxing), video games (preferably Xbox), and anything Star Wars related. My experience with team sports such as basketball and football has helped me learn to work with groups of people to accomplish a common goal. My experience in the ring is also a big contributor to my work ethic. It takes a different level of determination and it's an ultimate test of willpower and mental fortitude when competing in front of a crowd against another trained opponent. Fighting has not only strengthened me physically, but it has taught me discipline and dedication--two traits that anyone should have if they want to become successful at anything. I would love to combine my skills as a developer with my knowledge and with sports to design mobile apps for athletic companies like Nike or UFC. I would also like to develop professional websites for small businesses that want to promote their products.
